# Task 03 - Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset

This project is part of my internship task where I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## 📌 Dataset Used
- *Bank Marketing Dataset* from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- Features like age, job, marital status, education, default, balance, housing, loan, contact, day, month, duration, campaign, etc.
- Target variable: y (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit)

## 📊 Objective
Build a machine learning model using Decision Tree that:
- Predicts the likelihood of customer purchase
- Uses preprocessing and training pipeline
- Evaluates performance using accuracy and classification report

## 🧠 Algorithm
- Decision Tree Classifier from sklearn.tree

## 📁 Files Included
- Bank additional full.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook for model building
- README.md – Project summary

## 🔧 Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Label encoding of categorical variables
4. Splitting data into train and test sets
5. Training Decision Tree Classifier
6. Prediction and accuracy evaluation

## 🔍 Evaluation
- Accuracy score
- Classification report

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
jupyter notebook "Bank additional full.ipynb"
